# 🏫 Online Gatepass Approval System (MERN Stack)

An **Online Gatepass Approval System** built using the **MERN Stack** that allows students to apply for gatepasses digitally and rectors to approve or reject requests based on **hostel-wise access**.

This system eliminates paperwork and provides a **secure, role-based, real-time approval workflow**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Panel
- Secure student login (JWT-based authentication)
- Apply for gatepass online
- View gatepass status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
- View gatepass history
- Restriction: Cannot apply for a new gatepass if one is already pending
- Responsive UI for mobile and desktop

### 👨‍💼 Rector Panel (Hostel-Based)
- Secure rector login
- **Multiple rectors supported**
- Each rector is assigned a specific **hostel**
- Rector can:
  - View only gatepasses of students from their hostel
  - Approve or reject gatepass requests
  - See student details while approving (name, email, department, hostel)
- Status updates happen **instantly without page refresh**

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Student / Rector)
- Hostel-based authorization for rectors
- Protected routes (frontend + backend)

## 🧠 Key Concept: Multiple Rector Login (Hostel-Based)

- Each rector account is linked to **one hostel**
- When a rector logs in:
  - They can **only see gatepasses from students of their hostel**
  - They cannot access or approve gatepasses from other hostels
- This ensures **data isolation, security, and real-world accuracy**

Example:
- Rector A → Hostel A → Can approve only Hostel A students
- Rector B → Hostel B → Can approve only Hostel B students
